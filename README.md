Bakery Project
This is a web application designed as an online bakery where users can browse and order a delightful selection of amazing pastries. The project provides a seamless experience for customers to view products and place orders, while administrators can efficiently manage the product catalog from the backend.

Features
Product Catalog: Browse a variety of pastries with images, descriptions, and prices.

User Ordering: (Future/Planned) Functionality for users to place orders.

Admin Panel: Backend interface for administrators to add, edit, and delete products.

Image Management: Upload and display product images.

Pagination: Easily navigate through large product listings.

Installation and Setup
To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

PHP (>= 8.1): With necessary extensions (e.g., mbstring, pdo_mysql, bcmath, xml).

Composer: PHP dependency manager.

Node.js & npm (or Yarn): For frontend asset compilation (if applicable, though current template uses direct CSS/JS).

MySQL (or other database): A database server.

Steps
Clone the Repository:

git clone cake_shop_laravel
cd cake_shop_laravel

Install PHP Dependencies:

composer install

Set Up Environment File:
Copy the .env.example file to .env:

cp .env.example .env

Open the .env file and configure your database connection:

DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password

Replace your_database_name, your_database_user, and your_database_password with your actual database credentials.

Generate Application Key:

php artisan key:generate

Run Database Migrations:
This command will create the necessary tables in your database, including products and categories.

php artisan migrate

Note: In our previous conversation, there was a mention of python manage.py migrate. Please note that this project uses Laravel (PHP), so the correct command for database migrations is php artisan migrate.

Create Storage Symlink:
This command creates a symbolic link from public/storage to storage/app/public, allowing your uploaded images to be publicly accessible.

php artisan storage:link

Serve the Application:

php artisan serve

This will start a development server, usually at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Usage
Admin Access (Backend)
Currently, product management is handled by administrators through the backend.

Access Admin Routes: You would typically have routes like /products/create (to add a new product), /products/{id}/edit (to edit an existing product), and /products (to list products).

Add Products: As an administrator, you can add new pastries, including their name, price, description, category, and an image.

Manage Products: Existing products can be updated or deleted.

User View (Frontend)
Users can visit the main shop page (e.g., /products or your home page if it lists products) to see the amazing pastries available for sale. Pagination is implemented to browse through the catalog.
